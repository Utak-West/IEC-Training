# Gamified Training System - Technical Specifications

## 1. System Architecture

The system will be built on a modern, scalable, and cost-effective no-code/low-code architecture, leveraging the successful model of the MetroPower-Manpower-Dashboard. This approach will enable rapid development, easy maintenance, and a professional user experience.

### Core Components:

*   **Frontend**: Noloco (Professional Plan)
*   **Backend/Database**: Airtable (Pro Plan)
*   **AI Engine**: Custom Python-based engine deployed as a serverless function.
*   **Gamification Engine**: Custom Python-based engine deployed as a serverless function.
*   **Integration Layer**: A combination of Noloco's built-in integrations and custom webhooks.

## 2. Frontend (Noloco)

*   **Custom Branding**: The platform will be branded with the logos, colors, and fonts of IEC and A.M. Consulting.
*   **Responsive Design**: The platform will be fully responsive and accessible on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
*   **Component Library**: Noloco's pre-built component library will be used to create a consistent and user-friendly interface.

## 3. Backend (Airtable)

*   **Database Schema**: A detailed database schema will be designed to store all user data, project data, training content, and gamification metrics. The schema will be based on the MetroPower-Manpower-Dashboard model, with extensions for the specific needs of the IEC training program.
*   **Data Relationships**: Airtable's relational database capabilities will be used to create complex relationships between users, projects, courses, and achievements.
*   **API Integration**: The Airtable API will be used to connect the backend with the frontend, AI engine, and gamification engine.

## 4. AI Engine

*   **Technology Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn
*   **Deployment**: The AI engine will be deployed as a serverless function (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) to ensure scalability and cost-effectiveness.
*   **APIs**: The AI engine will expose a set of RESTful APIs for personalizing learning paths, providing real-time feedback, and adapting the difficulty of project simulations.

## 5. Gamification Engine

*   **Technology Stack**: Python, FastAPI
*   **Deployment**: The gamification engine will be deployed as a serverless function to ensure scalability and cost-effectiveness.
*   **APIs**: The gamification engine will expose a set of RESTful APIs for managing points, badges, leaderboards, and avatar customization.

## 6. Integration Layer

*   **Noloco Integrations**: Noloco's built-in integrations will be used to connect the frontend with the backend (Airtable).
*   **Webhooks**: Custom webhooks will be used to connect the frontend with the AI engine and gamification engine.
*   **API Gateway**: An API gateway (e.g., Amazon API Gateway, Google Cloud Endpoints) will be used to manage all API calls between the different components of the system.

## 7. Security

*   **Authentication**: User authentication will be handled by Noloco's built-in authentication system, which supports email/password, Google, and other social logins.
*   **Authorization**: Role-based access control will be implemented to ensure that users only have access to the data and features they are authorized to use.
*   **Data Encryption**: All data will be encrypted at rest and in transit.
*   **Compliance**: The platform will be designed to be compliant with all relevant data privacy regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA.

## 8. Performance

*   **Scalability**: The serverless architecture will ensure that the platform can scale to meet the needs of a growing user base.
*   **Availability**: The platform will be designed to be highly available, with a target uptime of 99.9%.
*   **Latency**: The platform will be designed to have low latency, with a target response time of under 200ms for all API calls.
